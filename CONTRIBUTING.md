```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/caravan
cd caravan
git remote add upstream https://github.com/unchained-capital/caravan

Starting caravan locally (this will open caravan in your default browser):

```sh
npm run start
```

## Creating Pull Requests

```sh
git checkout -b my-branch

3. Ensure your changes pass linting and testing:

To test:
```sh
npm test
```

To lint your changes:

```sh
npm run lint
```

4. Commit your changes:

`caravan` uses [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) to create commit messages so it can automatically create semantic releases.

```sh
git add .
npm run commit
# answer the questions
```

5. Push your changes:

```sh
git push origin my-branch
```

5. Open [this project on GitHub](https://github.com/unchained-capital/caravan), then click ‚ÄúCompare & pull request‚Äù.

## Releasing Caravan

Caravan is released to GitHub Pages (https://unchained-capital.github.io/) by using the following:

```sh
npm run release
git push --follow-tags origin master
```

Then go to GitHub and create a release in the UI.  This will trigger a build and deployment to GitHub pages.
